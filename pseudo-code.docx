For many people, probability calculations are often difficult to understand. They think, for example, that if they have rolled a 6, the probability of rolling another 6 is lower. However, the probability is the same for every dice roll.
To demonstrate this behaviour, a dice is to be simulated in a small PHP software project. The following tasks should be fulfilled by the application:
a) The user should enter the number of times the dice will be rolled and press a submit button to start the application.
b) The PHP Script checks for a valid user input between 1 and 1000.
c) The entered value should be displayed.
d) The result of each roll should be displayed.
e) At the end, the number of times a six was rolled should also be displayed like this:

We roll the dice 6 times

1. You rolled a 2
2. You rolled a 1
3. You rolled a 2
4. You rolled a 6
5. You rolled a 3
6. You rolled a 6

You rolled the six 2 times!


a) Describe step-by-step the procedure/workflow/pseudo code of your application before specifying any HTML/PHP source code.
PSEUDO-CODE:
numberDiceToRoll = Input();   
if(not(numberDiceToRoll.between(1, 1000))) then throw Exception();
display(numberDiceToRoll);
for(index = 0; index < numberDiceToRoll; index++){
	randomNumberArray[index] = random(1, 6);
	display(randomNumberArray[index]);
}
display(messageByTheGivenPattern);
